CROSS JOIN 
-----------
	- The cross join specofies that all rows from first table join with the all of the rows of second table 
	- if there are "x" rows in table1 and "y" rows in table2 then the cross join result set have x*y rows.
	- it normally happens when no matching join columns are specified in simple words you can say that if two tables in a join query have no join condition, then the oracle returns their cartesian product 

		syntax:

			SELECT * FROM table1
			CROSS JOIN table2;
			
				(OR)

			SELECT * FROM table1,table2

INNER JOIN 
-------------
 - Inner join is simplest and most common type of join. it is also known as simple join 
 - it will returns all rows from multiple tables where the join condition is met 
 - the inner join is such a join when equijoins and nonequijoins are performed, rows from the source and target tables are matched using a join condition formulated with equality and inequality operators, respectively 
	syntax:
		 SEELCT column FROM table1
		 INNER JOIN table2 
		 ON table1.column = table2.column;


- In Oracle we performed inner join BETWEEN two tables in a common operation 
- Lets assume we have two tables table1 and table2 
- Here we want wo perform an inner join based on a common column 

 	Syntax:

		SELECT *
		FROM table1
		INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.common_column = table2.common_column;

 - If Want to to specify additional conditions for the join we can include them in the ON clause 

		SELECT *
		FROM table1
		INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.common_column = table2.common_column
		WHERE table1.other_column = 'some_value';

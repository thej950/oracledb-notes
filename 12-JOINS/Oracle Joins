Oracle Joins
------------
 - Join is a query that is used to combine rows from two or more tables, views or materialized views 
 - it will retrieve data from multiple tables and we can create a new table 
 - there may be at least one join condition either in the FROM clause or in the WHERE clause for joining two tables 
 - it compares two columns from different tables and combines pair of rows, each containing one row from each table, for which join condition is true 

 	Types of Joins
 	---------------
 	 1. Equi Joins and Non-Equi Joins 
 	 2. Innser Joins (simple joins)
 	 3. Outer Joins 
 	    - Left Outer Join
 	    - Right outer Join
 	    - Full Outer Join
 	 4. Self Join
 	 5. Cross Join (Cartesian Products)
 	 6. Natural Joins
 	 7. Anti Joins
 	 8. semi Joins


EQUI JOIN
----------
 - This Oracle Equi joins return the matching column values of the associated tables 
 - it uses a comparison operator in the WHERE clause to refer equality This is represented by (=) sign 
 - equi Join also can be performed by using JOIN keyword followed by ON keyword and then specifying names of the columns along with their associated tables to check equality 

 	Syntax:

 		SELECT column_list FROM table_1, table_2... 
 		WHERE table_1.column_nanme = table_2.column_name;

 				OR

 		SELECT * FROM table_1 JOIN table2 [ON (join_condition)]



Non-Equi Join

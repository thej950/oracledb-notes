Subqueries in Oracle
---------------------
 - In Oracle subquery is a query within a query 
 - we can create subqueries within our SQL statements 
 - These subqueries can resides in the WHERE clause, in the form of clause, or SELECT clause 
 - A query inside query is called a subquery or nested query in Oracle 
 - the subquery having two more queries Thses are as follows
 	1. Innser Or Child Or subnquery
 	2. Outer Or Parent Or Main query

 	syntax: SELECT * FROM <TBALE_NAME> WHERE CONDITION (SELECT * FROM......);

 As per the excution process of subquery it is again classified into two categorised 
  1. Non-Correlated Subqueries 
   - In Non-Correlated subqueries, first the inner query will excute and return value and later outer query will excute 

  2. Correlated Subqueries 
   - In Correlated subqueries first outer query will excute and return value and later inner query will excute 

  The Non-correlated suqueries again classified into 4 types there in below 
   1. single row subquery
   2. multiple row subquery
   3. multiple column subquery
   4. Inline view subquery

   Oracle Single Row Subquery
   	- when a subquery returns a single value that is called "Single Row Subquery"
   	- In Single Row Subquery we can use operators as "=,<,>,<=,>=,!="

   Multiple Row Subqueries
    - When a subquery returns more than one value is called a Multiple Row Subquery in Oracle 
    - In this multiple row subquery, we can use the operators such as "IN,ANY,ALL"

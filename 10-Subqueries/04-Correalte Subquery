Correalte Subquery
--------------------
 - A Correlated subquery is evaluated once for each row processed by the parent statement 
 - A correlated subquery is one way of reading every row in a table and comparing values in each row against related data 
 - it is used whenever a subquery must return a different result or set of results for each candidate row considered by the main query 
 - In other words  we can use correlated subquery to answer a multipart question whose answer depends on the value in each row processed by the parent statement
 	
 	syntax:

 		SELECT column1,column2,...
 			FROM table1 outer 
 			WHERE column1 operator
 				(SELECT column1,column2
 				FROM table2
 				WHERE expr1 = 
 					outer expr2);


 	1. Find all the employees who are earn more than the average salary in their department

 		SQL> select ename,sal,deptno from employee outer where sal>(select avg(sal) from employee where deptno=outer.deptno);

		ENAME             SAL     DEPTNO
		---------- ---------- ----------

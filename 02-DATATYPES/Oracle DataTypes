Oracle DataTypes
----------------
- Data types are used to store some data in the fields or columns
- Data types can used in database in what type of data we used in the field of table in the database there we need to use Datatype 

	Charecter Datatypes
	---------------------
	 - character datatypes are used to define in CHAR,NCHAR,VARCHAR2,NVARCHAR2 and VARCHAR
	 	- NCHAR and NVARCHAR2 data types are used to store unicode charecter strings
	 	- CHAR and NCHAR are used to store fixed data types 
	 	- VARCHAR and NVVARCHAR2 datatypes are used to variable length content

	  	 - Note: VARCHAR is the synonymes for VARCHAR2 (so here we mostly use only VARCHAR only because it may change its semantics in the future)
	  	 - Note: Charecter datatypes we can specify their sizes in either in bytes or charecters

	Number Datatypes
	-----------------
	 - The NUMBER datatype is for precision p and for scale s the precision ranges from 1 to 38 while scale range from -84 to 127
	 - If we downt specify precision, The column can values including fixed point numbers. the default value for scale is zero 
	 - if we specify using INT datatype it will automatically take upto 38 sized field only 

	 	- Note: Here we mostly use NUMBER datatype only 

	Date time and interval data types
	---------------------------------
	 - To store date and time for we use DATE datatype we use 
	 - To store date and with fraction of seconds to store we use datatypes like DATE,TIMESTAMP, TIMESTAMPWITHLOCALTIMEZONE, 
	 - to store interval with date and time we use datatypes like INTERVALYEARTOMONTH, and INTERVALDAYTOSECOND. The values of interval datatypes are interval

	RAW AND LONGRAW datatypes
	----------------------------
	 - Here to store any photos and videos there we use RAW and LONGRAW data types we use 
	 - these are used to store from binary data or byte string (like example content of documents and sound files and video files)
	 - The RAW datatypes store upto 2000 bytes 
	 - The LONGRAW datatypes will store upto 2GB.
	   - Note: it will store all the content like photos and videos and sounds in a binary format

	BFILE Datatype
	---------------
	 - This BFILE data types mainly used to store locater content if that locater may containe folder and files that may available outside the database (which means in simple words that may be used to call like Link file )
	 - Here mainly actual content will be outside of the database 
	 - here we use by help of BFILE datatype we store link of that actual content it may containe large folder or file

	BLOB Datatype
	--------------
	 - BLOB stands for Binary Large Object.
	 - using BLOB datatype to store data in the form of Binary Objects with maximum size of [(4 gigatypes - 1) * (Total Database block size)]

	CLOB Datatype
	--------------
	 - CLOB stands for charecter Large Object.
	 - we can use CLOB datatype for store singlebyte and multibyte charecter with the maximum size is [(4 gigabyte -1 ) * (Total database block size)]
	  - Note: CLOB datatype supports Both fixed and variable charecter sets 

	NCLOB Datatype
	--------------
	 - NCLOB is similar to CLOB but it stores in a unicode charecters

	UROWID Datatype
	----------------
	 - The UROWID is primarly for values returned by the ROWID from pseudo-column. its values are base64 strings that represents the unique address of in a table

TRUNCATE
-----------
 - In Oracle SQL the TRUNCATE statement is more efficient way to remove rows in the table in a quick way 
 - Ulike delete statement delete rows step by step and generate undo logs 
 - truncate statement is more efficient way to delete all rows from a table 
 - It more important while using trucate statemnt for any table make sure backup is important 

 	syntax:

 		TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;


 	Fetures:
 	 - speed : 
 	 	- truncate is fater compare to delete statament because it will not generate logs unlike delete statement 
 	 	- it will deallocate data blocks, effectivily removing all rows at once 

 	 - Rollback:
 	 	- Unlike delete statement TRUNCATE statment cannot rollback once trucate excution on an table data is gone thats why make sure while excute truncate statment
 	 	- this is more important in production environment 

 	 - Constraints and Triggers:
 	 	- Truncate might have restriction when foreign key constraints, uniq constraints, or triggers are present on the table 
 	 	- it may require additional privillages for removal of dependent objects 

 	 - space reclamation: 
 	 	- Releases the space associated with the table, reducing the water mark for the table 
 	 	- This operation is more efficient in terms of space than a DELETE

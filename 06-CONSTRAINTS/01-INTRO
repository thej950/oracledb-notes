Introduction of Constraints
------------------------------

DATA INTEGRITY CONSTRAINTS
----------------------------
1. What is Data Integrity In Oracle
  - Data integrity means the data containes in the database need to be accurate and consistent and reliable
  - To provide data integrity "RDBMS" Provide us a Set of Integrity Constraints those will ensurs the whatever data entered in to database is going to be accurate, consistent, and reliable. 
  - This is the Main reason why end user Trust the database.

  Note: Thses Constraints will Maintain from Data miss manage in the Database  

  This Data Integrity again Classified Into Two Types
  ----------------------------------------------------
  	1. Pre-defined Data integrity (using constraints) or Declarative
  	2. User-defined data integrity (using triggers) or Procedural

  	Predefined Data integrity: 
  	--------------------------
  		- This Data Integrity can be implemented with the help of "Constraints"
  		- These are again Three Types

  			1. Entity Integrity
  			2. Referential Integrity
  			3. Domain Integrity 

  		1. Entity Integrity: 
  			- it will ensure each Row is Uniquely Identified in a Table.
  			- To Implement This Mechanism we use "primary key" or "unique" constraint.
  		2. Referential Integrity:

  			- It will Ensure To create a Relationship between tables.
  			- To Implement This Mechanism we use "foreign key"
  		
  		3. Domain Integrity:
  			- Domain is Nothing But a Column.
  			- It will ensure that To check values with user define conditions before accepting values into a column
  			- To Perform This Mechanism we use "check", "default", "not null" constraints

 Constraints In Oracle:
 ------------------------
	- This Constrints in Oracle are Basically used to restrict the Insertion of Unwanted data in the database.
	- which means They are Mainly used to Maintain Data Integrity
	- we can create the constraint on single column or Multiple columns of a table in Oracle

	Types of Constraints available in Oracle:
	--------------------------------------------

		- NOT NULL Constraint
		- UNIQUE KEY Constraint
		- CHECK KEY Constraint
		- PRIMARY KEY Constraint
		- FOREIGN KEY OR REFERENCE KEY Constraint
		- DEFAULT Constraint


 How To Create Contraints in Oracle
 ------------------------------------
  - All Database are supporting the Below Following Two types of methods To Define Constraints 
  	1. Column Level
  	2. Table level

  	Column Level constraint:
  		- In this method we are defining constraints on indivudual columns.

  		Syntax:

  			CREATE TABLE <table_name> (<column_name1> <datatype> <constraint_type>,.............);

  	Table Level constriant:
  		- In this method we are defining constraints after all columns are declared at the end of the table defintion

  		Syntax:

  			CREATE TABLE <table_name> (<column_name> <data_type>, <column_name> <data_type>,............ <constraint_type>);

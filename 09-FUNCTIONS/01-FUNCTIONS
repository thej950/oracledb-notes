FUNCTIONS IN Oracle
--------------------
 - A Function In Oracle is a subprogram that is used to perform an action 
 - Such as complex calculations and return the result of the action of a value 
 - There are two types of function in Oracle 
 	1. User Defined Function Or Pre-Defined Function Or Built-In Functions
 	2. User Defined Functions

Pre-Defined Functions Or Built_in Functions In Oracle
------------------------------------------------------
 - This Function which are already defined by Oracle system 
 - They are Ready to be used by user or Developed or called system defined functions 
 - These are again classified into Two Ways

 	1. Single Row Functions (Scalar Functions)
 	2. Multiple Row Functions (Grouping Functions)

 	Single Row Functions In Oracle 
 	-------------------------------
 	 - Single Row Functions are returning a single Row Or a Single value
 	 	1. Numeric Or Math Calculations 
 	 	2. String Or Char Functions
 	 	3. Date Or Time Functions
 	 	4. Conversion Functions
 	 	5. Analytics Functions 
 	 	6. Advanced Functions

 	 How To call a Function In Oracle

 	 	Syntax:

 	 		SELECT <function_name> <values> From Dual;

 	 	What is Dual In Oracle
 	 	 - It is a Predefined Table in Oracle
 	 	 - It is Having sigle Column and Single Row
 	 	 - It is called a Dummy Table In Oracle
 	 	 - It is Mainly used for testing (user and pre-define) Functionalities

 	 	Stucher Of Dual Table
 	 	 - DESC DUAL;

 	 	To See Data of Dual Table
 	 	 - SELECT * FROM DUAL;
 
	Note: From above Capital Letters and small Letters ASCII will Different
	Note: In System Every charecter has some Unique Number starts with 0 To 255
	Note: even space have one ASCII code like 32

    step1: create a table with columns and with datatypes 

    	SQL> create table emp_tbl (empno number(3), resume bfile);

		Table created.

		SQL>

	step2: create or replace a directory to point out to source file 


		SQL> create or replace directory MY_DOC as 'C:\Docs';

		Directory created.

		SQL>
		 - from above output that location 'c:\Docs' need to be available inside that folder our file_name should be there
		 - MY_DOC it is directory in Oracle it is point out to  OR locate to 'C:\Docs' path In Oracle 

	step3:  lets add values into table 

		SQL> insert into emp_tbl (empno,resume) values(100, BFILENAME ('MY_DOC', 'resume.docx'));

		1 row created.

		SQL>
		 - from above output we should available resume.docx file need to be in "C:\Docs" Path

Synonyms in Oracle
----------------------
 - using synonym we able to give alternate name to all objects in SQL
 - This Synonyms is a alternative object such as tables, views, sequences, stored procedures, and other database ojects 
 - we generally use synonyms when we are granting access to an object from another schema and we dont want the users have to worry about knowing which schema owns the object 

 	syntax: 
 		CREATE OR <REPLACE> <PUBLIC> SYNONYM <schema.> synonym_name FOR <schema.> object_name;

  PUBLIC
   - it means that the synonym is a public synonym and it is accessible to all users 
  schema
   - the appropriate schema. if this phrase is omitted, oracle assumes that you are referring to your own schema 
  object_name
   - The name of the object for which you are creating the syonym. it can be one of the following 

   		1. Table
   		2. view
   		3. sequence
   		4. stored procedure 
   		5. function
   		6. package
   		7. materialized view 
   		8. java class schema object 
   		9. user-defined object 
   		10. synonym 


   DROP Synonym 
    - To drop a existing synonyms 
    syntax: 

    	DROP <PUBLIC> SYNONYM <schema.> synonym_name <force>

    	PUBLIC
    	 - allow you to drop a public synonym. if we have specified PUBLIC, then you dont specify a schema 
    	force
    	 - it will force oracle to drop the synonym even if it has dependencies 
    	 - it is not recomended to use force it will cause a invalidation of oracle objects 


    1. here lets create a synonym for dept table 

		SQL> select * from dept;

		    DEPTNO DNAME      LOC
		---------- ---------- ---------------
		        10 PRODUCTION HYD
		        20 PURCHASE   CHENNAI
		        30 SALES      BANGALORE

		SQL> create synonym abcd_tbl for dept;

		Synonym created.

		SQL> select * from abcd_tbl;

		    DEPTNO DNAME      LOC
		---------- ---------- ---------------
		        10 PRODUCTION HYD
		        20 PURCHASE   CHENNAI
		        30 SALES      BANGALORE

		SQL> drop synonym abcd_tbl;

		Synonym dropped.

		SQL> select * from abcd_tbl;
		select * from abcd_tbl
		              *
		ERROR at line 1:
		ORA-00942: table or view does not exist


		SQL> 

	2. lets create a synonym for SEQUENCE (first create a sequence then add synonym for sequence)


		SQL>  create sequence my_sq minvalue 1 maxvalue 5 start with 1 increment by 1;

		Sequence created.

		SQL> create synonym sq for my_sq;

		Synonym created.


		SQL> select sq.nextval from dual;

		   NEXTVAL
		----------
		         1

		SQL> select sq.nextval from dual;

		   NEXTVAL
		----------
		         2

Note: From above objects table and sequence are two objects this synonym will all objects in SQL from above objects

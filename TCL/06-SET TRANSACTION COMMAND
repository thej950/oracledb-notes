SET TRANSACTION COMMAND
---------------------------- 
	- A SET TRASACTION in oracle is optional 
	- a new  transaction begins implicitly with the first DML statement that will excute after you make a database connection or with the first DML statement that you excute following a commit or a rollback 
	- You use SET TRANSACTION only when we want TRANSACTION ATTRIBUTES  such as READ ONLY that are not default 

	- The SET TRANSACTION marks the begining of a transaction 
	- Any changes we make to our data following the begiing of the trasaction are not made permanent untill we issue a COMMIT 
	- further more those changes will not visible to other users until we have to issue a commit 

		Syntax:

			SET TRANSACTION <READ ONLY | READ WRITE> <NAME 'transaction_name'>;

	- Transaction Types
		
		1. set transaction read write 
			- it is the default transaction type specified as a read write transaction 
			- it will allow us to issue statements like UPDATE and DELETE

		2. set transaction read only
			- it is read only transaction 
			- it will does not allow and delete statements like DML statements
